## Some Projects that i have done

- [Used Car Price Prediction](https://github.com/vaadewoyin/used-car-price-prediction): An end-to-end machine learning project focused on predicting used car prices using xgboost model.The project includes data collection, where over 19,000 car listings were scraped. The data was then cleaned and preprocessed, including handling missing values and outliers. Exploratory data analysis was conducted to gain insights into the dataset. Feature engineering techniques were applied to extract relevant information from the data. Several machine learning models were trained and evaluated to predict car prices based on various features. Finally, a user-friendly Flask web application was developed to allow users to interactively estimate car prices.

- [Bank term deposit subscription prediction](https://github.com/vaadewoyin/Bank-term-deposit-subscription-prediction): A classification project utilizing the Bank Marketing Data Set to predict if a client will subscribe to a term deposit. The project addresses class imbalance through class reweighing and undersampling. Evaluation metrics focus on recall to capture potential subscribers. Achieved recall improvements of up to 73% through class imbalance handling.Additionally, a Tableau dashboard was created to provide visualizations and insights.
